## Five Fun Facts About Me
1. I do digital art, hence majoring in graphic design.
2. I'm a dog person who never owned a dog before but wants one when I get older.
3. I know cantonese, but I'm slowly forgetting it ;-;
4. I like reading manga, watching tv shows, and writing my own stories (when I have the free time- which I currently have little of).
5. Donuts are my favorite desert. Glazed or sugar donuts always, a good donut only needs to be a good dough and a simple topping.
